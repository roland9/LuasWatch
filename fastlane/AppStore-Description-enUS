This app shows the departure times of the closest Luas station:

• Launch the app on your watch - use a Complication, ask Siri ('launch the LuasWatch app') or just tap the app icon
• That’s it!
• If the closest station is not the one you're interested in, you can select any other station from a list.

How the app works:
• Gets your location to find the closest Luas station (Red or Green line)
• Contacts the Luas Real Time Passenger Information (RTPI) service
• Shows you the departure times
